# take_home_task
Hello! This is a server side template engine implementation of the dashboard created with Flask and Jinja, so this implementation doesn't have an external API. I built this to fulfill the requirements of the task in case I couldn't figure out RESTful, but I did [here](https://github.com/jasenlo123/take_home_task2)!
